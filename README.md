# Gender-Bias-in-Language-Models
Submission for course CS 8803 DMM - Data Management and Machine Learning

Gender equality is aimed at promoting an equal representation for all genders, especially in the workplace. Language Models have gained much traction in the last few years in the NLP community. These models are used in a host of applications in the real world such as text-generation, summarization, entity matching and more. Our proposed research aims at identifying and comparing the gender bias that exists in these models, especially focusing on bias with respect to different professions. We aim to conclude a qualitative search on which model propagates a greater bias and hope to lead a dialogue into de-biasing these models.
